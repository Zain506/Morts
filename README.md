# Lead Generation and Qualification

- This repository creates a Streamlit app to view a MongoDB database.
- It will aim to apply ML techniques to classify a record in the database into 1 of 2 categories
- We will attempt to create an embedding for each datapoint using a language model encoder
- Then we will generate embeddings for 2 example categories and apply a softmaxxed cosine similarity
- This builds on the existing MedCLIP architecture of using lightweight tools to generate a simple ground truth
- This can be expanded on in the future when we have more information about each record's true classification (requires manual addition)

## Requirements
- Lightweight
- Support classification
- Support training
- No APIs
